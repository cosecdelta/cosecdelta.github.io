title: "Deep-Learning based Tumor Segmentation in Multiparametric MR"
excerpt: " Developed a end-to-end pipeline for automatic tumor segmentation and quantitative analysis for preclinical multiparametric Triple Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) PDX MR images. The pipeline consists of a novel deep-learning architecture called **Dense Recurrent Residual U-Net (DR2U-Net)** for automatic tumor segmentation. Further we extracted radiomics features from the segmented maps to validate the robustness of segmentation boundaries and estabilished the reporducibility of the framework. <br/><img src='/images/dl-seg.JPG'>"

In this project I implemented the [Reward Constrained Policy Optimization Paper](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SkfrvsA9FX) by Tessler et al. into stable-baselines3 implementation of PPO. Additionally, I reproduced the original results by tracking my experiments using weights and biases. The code for this project can be found [here](https://github.com/sudo-Boris/stable-baselines3). I also wrote an article elaborating on the theory of RCPO and my results and submitted it to the ICLR Blogposts Track! You can fin the article [here](https://iclr-blogposts.github.io/staging/blog/2023/Adaptive-Reward-Penalty-in-Safe-Reinforcement-Learning/)
