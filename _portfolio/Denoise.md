title: "Deep-Learning Framework to generate Standard-Count PET from Low-Count PET"
excerpt: " Developed a deep-learning powered pipeline for generating quantitative Standard-Count preclinical PET (SC-PET) images from different realizations of Low-Count preclinical PET (LC-PET). For generating SC-PET images we developed a novel deep-learning architecture called Attention based Residual Dilated Network (ARD-Net) consisting of Enhancement Attention Modules (EAM) for efficient feature learning and feature consolidation. The performance of the architecture was evaluated utilizing a multiobjective evaluation framework which consists of fidelity based metrics, task based segmentation performance analysis followed by a task-based quantification analysis to test the robustness of our designed DL framework to extreme low-count PET quantitative and segmentation recovery. <br/> The above pipeline was also replicated to design a self-supervised learning framework utilizing the Noise2Noise principle where SC-PET images were generated from Low-Count PET images only without corresponding ground truth. To realize the N2N principle we implemented the N2N Multi-Block Residual Networ (N2N-MBRNet) which consists of multiple residual units.

### Project Description
Low-count PET (LC-PET) acquisition in preclinical context has multiple benefits in terms of improving animal logistics, preserving integrity in longitudinal studies and in increasing scanner throughput while decreasing radiation risk. Low count imaging implemented either by reducing scan-time or injected radiolabeled agent can lead to significant reduction in photon count level thus generating PET images with poor diagnostic quality, quantitative uncertainties and detection difficulties. To address this tradeoff challenge our aim is to develop a deep-learning based novel framework for generating Standard-Count PET (PET) images from LC-PET across different photon levels optimized for preclinical standards. The quality of the DL generated SC-PET images would be evaluated using not only traditional fidelity based image quality metrics but also in context of task-based segmentation performance and task-based quantification analysis (SUV Measurements and Radiomics) with respect to true SC-PET. This would validate the diagnostic ability and quantitative performance of the DL generated SC-PET being used for analyzing therapeutic efficacy.
