title: "Deep-Learning Framework to generate Standard-Count PET from Low-Count PET"
excerpt: " Developed a deep-learning powered pipeline for generating quantitative Standard-Count preclinical PET (SC-PET) images from different realizations of Low-Count preclinical PET (LC-PET). For generating SC-PET images we developed a novel deep-learning architecture called Attention based Residual Dilated Network (ARD-Net) consisting of Enhancement Attention Modules (EAM) for efficient feature learning and feature consolidation. The performance of the architecture was evaluated utilizing a multiobjective evaluation framework which consists of fidelity based metrics, task based segmentation performance analysis followed by a task-based quantification analysis to test the robustness of our designed DL framework to extreme low-count PET quantitative and segmentation recovery. <br/> The above pipeline was also replicated to design a self-supervised learning framework ustlizing the Noise2Noise principle where SC-PET images were generated from Low-Count PET images only without corresponding ground truth.  <br/><br/><img src='/images/dl-denoise.JPG'>"
