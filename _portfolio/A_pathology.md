title: "Deep-Learning framework for identifying cross-scale correlation in multiscale preclinical imaging "
excerpt: " Developing a deep-learning based computational pipeline to integrate **multiscale preclinical imaging** consisting of in-vivo PET imaging, autoradiography and histopathology for analyzing biological interpretability and to improve therapeutic predictions. The framework consists of three different aspects (1) To develop **automatic registration** for multiscale imaging i.e., autoradiography (ex-vivo PET) with corresponding H&E and IHC data. (2) Developing a deep-learning based **correlative analysis pipeline (CorrNet)** for studying the correlation of autoradiography features (ex-vivo PET) to that histopathological features (H&E/IHC). (3) Correlate and integrate in-vivo data (PET) and histopathological data (H&E/IHC) in feature space by combining **cytometric and radiomics** features to predict therapeutic response <br/><br/><img src='/images/dl-denoise.JPG'>"
