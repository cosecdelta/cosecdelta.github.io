👨🏻‍💻 I'm fifth year PhD Student in [Imaging Science](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html) which is an interdisciplinary program between [McKelvey School of Engineering](https://engineering.wustl.edu/index.html) and [Washington University School of Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). I am part of the [Quantitative Molecular Systems and Imaging Lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/precision-radiotheranostics-translation-center-prtc/labs/shoghi-lab/) in Washington University School of Medicine under the supervision of [Dr. Kooresh I. Shoghi](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/employees/kooresh-shoghi/)

🔬 My research interests lies in the interface of developing machine-learning and deep-learning algorithm in context of medical imaging and computer vision. Specifically, my dissertation research titled "Development of computational imaging pipelines for preclinical imaging to advance co-clinical imaging and therapy" focuses on developing deep-learning based computational frameworks for multimodal/multiscale preclinical quantitative imaging which can used for predicting response.

🛠️ In the Summer of 2023, I worked as a Data Science Intern in [Bristol Myers Squibb](https://www.bms.com/) under the supervision of [Dr. Mariann Micsinai-Balan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariannmicsinai/) and [David Paulucci](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-paulucci/). I worked on developing novel deep-learning pipelines to 
# Selected Experience



## 🤖 Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## 📜 Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## 👨🏻‍🔬 Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## 📚 Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
