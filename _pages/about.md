<!---![Illustration of combining vision and language modalities](/images/image_to_text_vis.png){: .align-right width="300px"}-->
üë®üèª‚Äçüíª I'm fifth year **PhD Student** in [**Imaging Science**](https://engineering.wustl.edu/academics/programs/imaging-science/index.html) which is an interdisciplinary program between [McKelvey School of Engineering](https://engineering.wustl.edu/index.html) and [Washington University School of Medicine](https://medicine.wustl.edu/). I am part of the [Quantitative Molecular Systems and Imaging Lab](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-centers/precision-radiotheranostics-translation-center-prtc/labs/shoghi-lab/) in Washington University School of Medicine under the supervision of [*Dr. Kooresh I. Shoghi*](https://www.mir.wustl.edu/employees/kooresh-shoghi/).

üî¨ My research interests lies in the interface of developing **machine-learning/deep-learning** algorithm in context of medical imaging and computer vision. Specifically, my PhD dissertation research focuses on developing novel deep-learning based computational frameworks for multi-modal and multi-scale preclinical quantitative imaging for assessing therapeutic response. I am particularly passionate about designing foundational models which are quantitatively **interpretable, reproducible, scalable** and hence can be deployed for translational purposes in co-clinical imaging.

üõ†Ô∏è In the Summer of 2023, I worked as a **Data Science Intern** for [**Bristol Myers Squibb**](https://www.bms.com/) under the supervision of [*Dr. Mariann Micsinai-Balan*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariannmicsinai/) and [*David Paulucci*](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-paulucci/). I developed **deep learning-based pipelines** for automatic analysis of large dataset of multi-modal medical images, radiomics feature extraction, and prediction of patient outcomes, utilizing **Clinical Trial Data** and **Real-World Data (RWD)** to predict survival and therapeutic response.

## ü§ñ Open Source Contributions
I have experience contributing to [Arena Bench](https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav) a large open-source project for robotic obstacle avoidance using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Moreover, I have published a [respective paper](https://sudo-boris.github.io/publication/2022-Arena-Bench) at the IROS conference and in the Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) journal.

## üìú Reimplementing and Reproducing Papers
I have experience with independent research. I have implemented the Reward Constrained Policy Optimization paper into stable-baselines3 PPO and reproduced the original results by running and tracking experiments.

To accompany this work, I have submitted a blog post to the **ICLR** Blogposts Track communicating the paper's theory and my results.

Feel free to look at my specific [portfolio entry](https://sudo-boris.github.io/portfolio/RCPPO/).

## üë®üèª‚Äçüî¨ Professional Experience
Currently I am working as a **Student Researcher** at the Reliable Multimodal AI Lab at the TU Darmstadt under the supervision of Prof. Marcus Rohrbach working on **Generative Video-Language Modelling**.
Additionally, I have professional experience working as an **Applied Machine Learning Student Researcher** at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute. \
There I worked on dynamic traffic flow forecasting using Graph Neural Networks.

## üìö Teaching and Community Contributions
To further contribute to the Machine Learning community, I have a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@borismeinardus) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@boris.meinardus) channel where I publish educational Machine Learning content.
